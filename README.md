# semantic-similarity-between-multilingual-data-corpus
Model helps to rate the semantic similarity between the data corpus across different language.

Data Corpus: As an input we used "tale of two cities.txt" from gutenburg project.

Steps need to be followed:
   1.Need to select the data and convert the same to other languages using google translator.
   2.First we need to run the CSV generators, which generates the CSV files
   3.CSV file stores the similarity score for the sentences in data corpus.
   4.Then we run the classifier which generated the semantic similarity score between the corpus of different language.
